\section{What is it?}

XLS-FO \cite{wikixslfo,w3schoolxslfo} is a formatting language for XML data. The general idea behind XLS-FO is that XML data is converted using XLST to transform the XML data into XLS-FO. The XLS-FO document is then passed to the FO processor, which converts it into something readable (PDF or PS). 

\section{Structure}

It starts with a XML declaration and a root element. The root element also declares the namespace for XLS-FO. In the root element you would have a layout-master-set element which holds one or more page templates. The simple-page-master element, which is encapsulated in the layout-master-select, contains a single page name and must have a unique master-name attribute. The page-sequence elements describe the page contents and the master-reference attribute refers to the simple-page-master template (which must be the same name).

As you can see in listing\footnote{Example taken from http://www.w3schools.com/xslfo/xslfo\_output.asp} \ref{code:xslfo} the page-sequence refers to the simple-page-master, since it has the same name. The block is encapsulated in the flow, which is encapsulated in the page-sequence. The page-sequence refers to the simple-page-master template.
